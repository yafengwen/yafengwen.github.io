      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central goal of my research is to develop an individualized strategy to combine knowledge of host characteristic (e.g., genomics and microbiota) and individual factors (e.g., co-morbidities, co-administered medications, diet, etc.) to reduce cardiovascular (CV) diseases and its related comorbidities. This strategy is expected to positively impact the severity of illness, mortality and healthcare costs for those with gout and potentially patients with many other related diseases.\r\n\r\nMy thesis projects include:\r\nProject 1: Identify and quantify the impact of common and novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within very important pharmacogenes (VIPs)\r\nProject 2: Develop a genotype-guided strategy for dose selection of allopurinol to increase attainment of goal serum urate (SU)\r\nProject 3: Examine the association between genetic variants and SU-lowering effects of fenofibrate\r\nProject 4: Quantitatively examine how the microbiome profiles differ between healthy adults and patients receiving urate-lowering therapies (ULTs)\r\nProject 1\r\nWe have found important differences in allele frequencies for key SNPs (including HLA-B*58:01, CYP2C9*3A, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP4F2*3, and SLCO1B1*5) influencing selection of medications and dosages were found between the Hmong and East Asians. [2,4,12,14] These findings suggest different predicted warfarin dosing requirements and different HLA testing approaches between Hmong and East Asians. [1,4] The Hmong community have, in general, a positive attitude towards pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing. [3,13] We are currently conducting a separate focus group to gain more insights about the community’s perception on the utility and interpretation of PGx testing in mental health diseases. [7,11] To identify potential novel SNPs, we sequenced 286 pharmacogenes using next-generation sequencing. Using the current informatics tools, such as Astrolabe, we are working to translate our genotypic findings into clinically actionable information. Our current focus is on next generation sequencing of CYP2D6 in Hmong [6], and future goal will expand to other genes that are pertinent to gout and cardiovascular medications.\r\nProject 2\r\nObjective 2: We first determine if genetic variants affect the selection and use of ULT in patients with gout and/or hyperuricemia. This will be accomplished by our comprehensive systematic literature review. [9] We are also constructing a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model to evaluate patient factors, including renal function, weight, diuretic use, and SNPs on dose prediction of allopurinol to achieve target SU. [5]\r\nProject 3\r\nObjective 3: An alternative medication is required for patients with gout who cannot safely use allopurinol or are predicted poor responders. Fenofibrate represents a potential alternative that lowers SU, triglycerides and raises HDL-C, thereby reducing the risk of gout and cardiovascular disease. Genetic variants that modulate the triglyceride-lowering effect of fenofibrate, have not been studied on fenofibrate’s impact on SU-lowering response. My project is to conduct a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants that are implicated in the SU-lowering response of fenofibrate.\r\nProject 4\r\nObjective 4: Certain bacteria in the gut may impact the uric acid production leading to the development of hyperuricemia. We are conducting a pilot study involving 180 Hmong adults to test whether vitamin C can be used as an alternative SU-lowering agent and whether different gut microbiome profiles will have impact on its efficacy. This funded study is currently under review by UMN IRB. We expect to initiate the study in 2021 and complete interim analysis by the end of 2021.\r\n\r\nSelected publications\r\nPeer-Reviewed Publications\r\nSun B, Wen YF, Culhane-Pera KA, Thyagarajan B, Bishop J, Zierhut H, Muaj Lo M, Xiong T, Peng K, Holzer K, Lee K, and Straka RJ.
